# Learning C#

After searching and applying for dev jobs, I realized C#, .NET are very popular.

So, I decided to start learning C#. Once I am comfortable, I will dive into .NET then into Azure.

Also, this is my first time writing notes on Github!

First, with VS code I am using WSL as my dev environment (which is a VM running Linux which is my OS).

So, to be able to run : "dotnet run", I installed the .NET SDK for Linux and followed the insctructions.

Then, on VS code I installed the C# extension.

Since the .NET is installed at the root, I have to run : "export PATH="/home/kittycat/.dotnet:$PATH"".

To verify the path, run "echo $PATH"
