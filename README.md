# Learning C#

After searching and applying for dev jobs, I realized C#, .NET are very popular.

So, I decided to start learning C#. Once I am comfortable, I will dive into .NET then into Azure.

Also, this is my first time writing notes on Github!

When using WSL as the dev environment (which is a VM running Linux which is the OS),

Verify the path; run : "echo $PATH",

If the path is not set, run : "export PATH="/home/$SSH-USERNAME/.dotnet:$PATH"" (since the .NET is installed at the root).

So, to be able to run : "dotnet run", make sure to be in the directory.
